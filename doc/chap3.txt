  [33X[0;0YThis  chapter  describes  all  the  data structures used in this package. We
  start  with  a section on finite fields and what is already there in the [5XGAP[105X
  kernel  and  library.  Then  we  describe  compressed vectors and compressed
  matrices.[133X
  
  
  [1X3.1 [33X[0;0YFinite field elements[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThroughout  the  package,  elements  in  the  field  [22XGF(p)[122X of [22Xp[122X elements are
  represented  by  numbers  [22X0,1,...,p-1[122X  and  arithmetic  is just the standard
  arithmetic in the integers modulo [22Xp[122X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YBigger finite fields are done by calculating in the polynomial ring [22XGF(p)[x][122X
  in   one  indeterminate  [22Xx[122X  modulo  a  certain  irreducible  polynomial.  By
  convention,    we    use    the    so-called    [21XConway    polynomials[121X   (see
  [7Xhttp://www.math.rwth-aachen.de:8001/~Frank.Luebeck/data/ConwayPol/index.html[107X)
  for  this  purpose,  because they provide a standard way of embedding finite
  fields into their extension fields. Because Conway polynomials are monic, we
  can  store  coset representatives by storing polynomials of degree less than
  [22Xd[122X, where [22Xd[122X is the degree of the finite field over its prime field.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAs  of  this  writing,  [5XGAP[105X  has two implementation of finite field elements
  built  into  its  kernel and library, the first of which stores finite field
  elements  by storing the discrete logarithm with respect to a primitive root
  of  the  field. Although this is nice and efficient for small finite fields,
  it  becomes  unhandy  for  larger  finite fields, because one needs a lookup
  table  of  length [22Xp^d[122X for doing efficient addition. This implementation thus
  is  limited  to  fields with less than or equal to [22X65536[122X elements. The other
  implementation  using  polynomial arithmetic modulo the Conway polynomial is
  used  for  fields  with  more  than  [22X65536[122X  elements.  For  prime  fields of
  characteristic  [22Xp[122X  with  more than that elements, there is an implementation
  using integers modulo [22Xp[122X.[133X

  [1X3.2-1 [33X[0;0YPacking of prime field elements[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor this section, we assume that the base field is [22XGF(p^d)[122X, the finite field
  with  [22Xp^d[122X  elements, where [22Xp[122X is a prime and [22Xd[122X is a positive integer. This is
  realized  as  a field extension of degree [22Xd[122X over the prime field [22XGF(p)[122X using
  the  Conway  polynomial  [22Xc ∈ GF(p)[x][122X. We always represent field elements of
  [22XGF(p^d)[122X   by   polynomials  [23Xa  =  \sum_{{i=0}}^{{d-1}}  a_i  x^i[123X  where  the
  coefficients  [22Xa_i[122X  are in [22XGF(p)[122X. Because [22Xc[122X is monic, this gives a one-to-one
  correspondence between polynomials and finite field elements.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  memory  layout  for  compressed  vectors is determined by two important
  constants,  depending only on [22Xp[122X and the word length of the machine. The word
  length  is  4 bytes on 32bit machines (for example on the i386 architecture)
  and  8 bytes on 64bit machines (for example on the AMD64 architecture). More
  concretely,  a [21X[10XWord[110X[121X is an [10Xunsigned long int[110X in C and the length of a [10XWord[110X is
  [10Xsizeof(unsigned long int)[110X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThose  constants are [10Xbitsperel[110X (bits per prime field element) and [10Xelsperword[110X
  (prime  field  elements  per [10XWord[110X). [10Xbitsperel[110X is [22X1[122X for [22Xp=2[122X and otherwise the
  smallest  integer,  such  that [22X2^bitsperel > 2⋅ p-1[122X. This means, that we can
  store  the  numbers  from  [22X0[122X  to  [22X2⋅  p - 1[122X in [10Xbitsperel[110X bits. [10Xelsperword[110X is
  [22X32/bitsperel[122X  rounded  down  to  the next integer and multiplied by [22X2[122X if the
  length  of  a  [10XWord[110X  is [22X8[122X bytes. Note that we thus store as many prime field
  elements as possible into one [10XWord[110X, however, on 64bit machines we store only
  twice as much as would fit into 32bit, even if we could pack one more into a
  [10XWord[110X.  This  has  technical  reasons  to  make  conversion between different
  architectures more efficient.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThese definitions imply that we can put [10Xelsperword[110X prime field elements into
  one  [10XWord[110X.  We  do this by using the [10Xbitsperel[110X least significant bits in the
  [10XWord[110X  for  the  first prime field element, using the next [10Xbitsperel[110X bits for
  the  next  prime  field element and so on. Here is an example that shows how
  the  [22X6[122X  finite field elements [22X0,1,2,3,4,5[122X of [22XGF(11)[122X are stored in that order
  in  one 32bit [10XWord[110X. [10Xbitsperel[110X is here [22X4[122X, because [22X2^4 < 2⋅ 11 - 1 = 21 < 2^5[122X.
  Therefore [10Xelsperword[110X is [22X5[122X on a 32bit machine.[133X
  
  [4X[32X  Example  [32X[104X
    [4X[28X most significant xx|.....|.....|.....|.....|.....|..... least significant[128X[104X

  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0YHere  is  another  example  that  shows  how  the  [22X20[122X  finite field elements
  [22X0,1,2,0,0,0,1,1,1,2,2,2,0,1,2,2,1,0,2,2[122X of [22XGF(3)[122X are stored in that order in
  one  64bit  [10XWord[110X.  [10Xbitsperel[110X  is  here  [22X3[122X, because [22X2^2 < 2⋅ 3 - 1 = 5 < 2^3[122X.
  Therefore  [10Xelsperword[110X  is  [22X20[122X on a 32bit machine. Remember, that we only put
  twice as many elements in one 64bit [10XWord[110X than we could in one 32bit [10XWord[110X![133X

  [33X[0;0YNote  that  different  architectures  store  their [10XWord[110Xs in a different byte
  order  in  memory ([21Xendianess[121X). We do [13Xnot[113X specify how the data is distributed

  [33X[0;0YNow  that  we  have  seen how prime field elements are packed into [10XWord[110Xs, we
  proceed  to the description how compressed vectors are stored over arbitrary
  extension fields:[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAssume a compressed vector has length [22Xl[122X with [22Xl ≥ 0[122X. If [22Xd=1[122X (prime field), it
  just  uses  [22Xelsperword/l[122X  [10XWord[110Xs  (division  rounded up to the next integer),
  where  the  first  [10XWord[110X stores the leftmost [10Xelsperword[110X field elements in the
  first  [10XWord[110X  as  described  above and so on. This means, that the very first
  field element is stored in the least significant bits of the first [10XWord[110X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn   the   extension   field  case  [22XGF(p^d)[122X,  a  vector  of  length  [22Xl[122X  uses
  [22X(elsperword/l)*d[122X  [10XWord[110Xs (division rounded up to the next integer), where the
  first  [22Xd[122X  [10XWord[110Xs store the leftmost [10Xelsperword[110X field elements. The very first
  word  stores  all  the constant coefficients of the polynomials representing
  the  first  [10Xelsperword[110X field elements in their order from left to right, the
  second  [10XWord[110X  stores  the coefficients of [22Xx^1[122X and so on until the [22Xd[122X'th [10XWord[110X,
  which  stores  the coefficients of [22Xx^{d-1}[122X. Unused entries behind the end of
  the actual vector data within the last [10XWord[110X has to be zero!.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  following  example  shows,  how the [22X9[122X field elements [22Xx^2+x+1[122X, [22Xx^2+2x+2[122X,

  [1X3.4-1 [33X[0;0YByte ordering and word length[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  section  describes  the external representation of matrices. A special
  data  format  is  needed  here,  because  of  differences  between  computer
  architectures  with  respect to word length (32bit/64bit) and endianess. The
  term  [21Xendianess[121X refers to the fact, that different architectures store their
  long  words  in  a different way in memory, namely they order the bytes that
  together make up a long word in different orders.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  external  representation  is the same as the internal format of a 32bit
  machine with little endianess, which means, that the lower significant bytes
  of  a  [10XWord[110X are stored in lower addresses. The reasons for this decision are
  firstly  that  64bit  machines  can  do  the bit shifting to convert between
  internal  and external representation easier using their wide registers, and
  secondly,  that  the  nowadays most popular architectures i386 and AMD64 use
  both  little endianess, such that conversion is only necessary on a minority
  of machines.[133X

  [33X[0;0YThe header of a [10Xcmat[110X file consists of 5 words of 64bit each, that are stored
  in little endian byte order:[133X

        the value of [22Xd[122X to describe the base field                             
        the number of rows of the matrix                                      
        the number of columns of the matrix

  [33X[0;0YAfter  these  [22X40[122X bytes follow the data words as described above using little
  endian 32bit [10XWord[110Xs as in the internal representation on 32bit machines.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNote  that  the  decision  to  put  not  more than twice as many prime field
  elements  into  a  64bit  [10XWord[110X  than  would  fit into a 32bit [10XWord[110X makes the
  conversion  between  internal  and  external  representation  much easier to
  implement.[133X
