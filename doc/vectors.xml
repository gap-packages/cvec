<ManSection>
<Meth Name="CVec" Arg="coeffs, cvecclass" Label="coefflcvecclass"/>
<Returns>a new mutable <C>cvec</C></Returns>
<Description>
    This method takes a coefficient list and a <C>cvecclass</C>
    as arguments. Assume the vector will be over <M>GF(p,d)</M> with
    <M>q=p^d</M>. For the coefficient list <A>coeffs</A> there exist
    several possibilities, partially depending on the base field size. 
    The easiest way is to use &GAP; finite
    field elements, which will be put into the new vector in the same 
    order. If <M>d=1</M>, one can always use &GAP; immediate integers
    between <M>0</M> and <M>p-1</M>, the vector will then contain the 
    corresponding cosets in <M>GF(p)=Z/pZ</M>. If <M>q</M> is small enough
    to be a &GAP; immediate integer, then one can use &GAP; immediate
    integers that are equal to the <M>p</M>-adic expansion using the
    coefficients of the representing polynomial as coefficients. That is,
    if an element in <M>GF(p,d)</M> is represented by the polynomial
    <M>\sum_{{i=0}}^{{d-1}} a_i x^i</M> with <M>a_i \in \{0,\ldots,p-1\}</M>,
    then one has to put <M>\sum_{{i=0}}^{{d-1}} a_i p^i</M> as integer into 
    the coefficient list <A>coeffs</A>. If <M>q</M> is larger, then
    <A>coeffs</A> must be a list of lists of length <M>d</M> 
    and contains for each field element of <M>GF(p,d)</M> 
    in the vector a list of its <M>d</M> coefficients of the representing 
    polynomial.
    For an explanation of the term <C>cvecclass</C> see Section <Ref
    Sect="cvecs"/> and <Ref Oper="CVecClass"/>. Of course, the length of
    the list <A>coeffs</A> must match the length of the vector given in the
    <C>cvecclass</C>.

After having encountered the concept of a <C>cvecclass</C> already
a few times it is time to learn how to create one. The following
operation is used first to create new <C>cvecclass</C>es and second
to ask a <C>cvec</C> for its class. In addition, it is used for
<C>csca</C>s.

<Section>
<Heading>Arithmetic</Heading>

Of course, the standard arithmetic infix operations <M>+</M>, <M>-</M> and
<M>*</M> (for vectors and scalars) work as expected by using the  
methods below. We start this section with a subsection on the usage of
scalars in arithmetic operations involving vectors.

<Subsection Label="scahandl">
<Heading>Handling of scalars in arithmetic operations</Heading>

In all places (like in <C>\*</C>) where vectors and scalars occur, the
following conventions apply to scalars:<P/>

&GAP; finite field elements can be used as scalars.<P/>

Integers between <M>0</M> and <M>p-1</M> (inclusively) can always be used as
scalars representing prime field elements via the isomorphism 
<M>GF(p)=Z/pZ</M>, also for extension fields. Larger integers than
<M>p-1</M>, as long as they are &GAP; immediate integers, are interpreted 
as the <M>p</M>-adic expansion of the coefficient list of the polynomial
representing the scalar. Note that this usage of immediate integers
differs from the standard list arithmetic in &GAP; because multiplication
with the integer <M>n</M> not necessarily means the same than <M>n</M> times
addition! Larger integers than immediate integers are not supported.

<Description>
    Both <A>v</A> and <A>w</A> must be <C>cvec</C>s over the same field

<Section>
<Heading>Element access and slicing</Heading>

<C>cvec</C>s behave to some extend like lists with respect to element access 
and slicing. However, they allow only actions that can be implemented
efficiently and that do not change their length. In addition there is a 
highly optimised function to copy contiguous sections of <C>cvec</C>s
into another <C>cvec</C>.

<ManSection>
<Meth Name="ELM_LIST" Arg="v, pos"/>
<Returns>a finite field element</Returns>
<Description>
This is a method for (reading) element access of vectors. <A>v</A> must
be a <A>cvec</A> and <A>pos</A> must be a positive integer not greater
than the length of <A>v</A>. The finite field element at position
<A>pos</A> in <A>v</A> is returned.<P/>

Note that the list access syntax <Q><A>v</A>[<A>pos</A>]</Q> triggers a call
to the <Ref Meth="ELM_LIST"/> operation.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Meth Name="ASS_LIST" Arg="v, pos, s"/>
<Returns>nothing</Returns>
<Description>
This is a method for (writing) element access of vectors. <A>v</A> must
be a <A>cvec</A> and <A>pos</A> must be a positive integer not greater
than the length of <A>v</A>. <A>s</A> must be a finite field element
or an integer. The finite field element at position
<A>pos</A> in <A>v</A> is set to <A>s</A>.<P/>

The scalar <A>s</A> is treated exactly as described in Subsection 
<Ref Subsect="scahandl"/>.<P/>

Note that the list access syntax 
<Q><A>v</A><C>[</C><A>pos</A><C>] := </C><A>s</A></Q>
triggers a call to the <Ref Meth="ASS_LIST"/> operation.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Meth Name="ELMS_LIST" Arg="v, l"/>
<Returns>a <C>cvec</C></Returns>
<Description>
This is a method for (reading) slice access of vectors. <A>v</A> must
be a <A>cvec</A> and <A>l</A> must be a range object or a list of positive 
integers not greater than the length of <A>v</A>. In both cases the list
of numbers must be contiguous list of valid positions in the vector.
A new <C>cvec</C> over the same field as <A>v</A> and with the same
length as <A>l</A> is created and returned. The finite field element at i
positions <A>l</A> in <A>v</A> are copied into the new vector.<P/>

Note that the list slice access syntax <Q><A>v</A>{<A>l</A>}</Q> triggers a 
call to the <Ref Meth="ELMS_LIST"/> operation.
</Description>
</ManSection>

Note that there intentionally is no write slice access to <C>cvec</C>s,
because in most cases this would lead to code that unnecessarily
copies data around in an expensive way. Please use the following function
instead:

<ManSection>
<Func Name="CVEC_Slice" Arg="src, dst, srcpos, len, dstpos"/>
<Returns>nothing</Returns>
<Description>
<A>src</A> and <A>dst</A> must be <C>cvec</C>s over the same field.
The field elements from positions <A>srcpos</A> to 
<M><A>srcpos</A>+<A>len</A>-1</M> in <A>src</A> are copied to positions 
from <A>dstpos</A> in <A>dst</A>. Of course all positions must be within
the vectors. <P/>

Note that this functions is quite efficient, however, the ranges are
checked. If you want to avoid this, use <C>CVEC&uscore;SLICE</C> instead (with
same calling convention), but do not complain later if crashes occur in
case of illegal positions used.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Meth Name="CopySubVector" Arg="src, dst, srcposs, dstposs"/>
<Returns>nothing</Returns>
<Description>
Implements the operation <Ref Oper="CopySubVector" BookName="Ref"/>
for <C>cvec</C>s <A>src</A> and <A>dst</A>, that is, <A>srcposs</A>
and <A>dstposs</A> must be ranges or plain lists of integers of equal
length such that all numbers contained lie between
<M>1</M> and the length of <A>src</A> and <A>dst</A> respectively.
The result is undefined if <A>src</A> and <A>dst</A> are the same
objects. The method is particularly efficient if both <A>srcposs</A>
and <A>dstposs</A> are ranges with increment <M>1</M>.

<Meth Name="CVEC_Concatenation" Arg="arg"/>
<Returns>a new <C>cvec</C> by concatenating all arguments</Returns>

base field. The result is a new <C>cvec</C>. A variable number of
<C>cvec</C>s over the same field can be given.

    Returns <C>true</C> if the <C>cvec</C> <A>v</A> is smaller than <A>w</A>.
    The vectors must be over the same field and must have equal
    length. The order implemented is very efficient but is <E>not</E> 
    compatible with lexicographic ordering of lists of

<Description>
    This operation unpacks a <C>cvec</C> <A>v</A> into its integer

    (containing the p-adic expansion of the polynomial representative of
    the residue class modulo the Conway polynomial, if the field has
    less or equal to <M>65536</M> elements. For larger finite fields each

<Func Name="CVEC_HashFunctionForCVecs" Arg="v, data"/>
<Returns>an integer hash value</Returns>
<Description>
    This is a hash function usable for the <Ref Oper="ChooseHashFunction"
BookName="orb"/> framework. It takes as arguments a <C>cvec</C>
<A>v</A> and a list <A>data</A> of length <M>2</M>. The first entry of
<A>data</A> is the length of the hash table used and the second entry
is the number of bytes looked at in the <C>cvec</C>.

<ManSection>
<Meth Name="ChooseHashFunction" Arg="v, hashlen"/>
<Returns>a record describing a hash function</Returns>
<Description>
Chooses a hash function to store <C>cvec</C>s like <A>v</A> in a hash table
of length <A>hashlen</A>. The return value is a record with components
<C>func</C> and <C>data</C> bound to <Ref
Func="CVEC_HashFunctionForCVecs"/> and a list of length <M>2</M> to be
given as a second argument to <Ref Func="CVEC_HashFunctionForCVecs"/>.
This allows to use <C>cvec</C>s in the <Ref Oper="ChooseHashFunction"
BookName="orb"/> framework.
