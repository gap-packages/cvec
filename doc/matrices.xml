<Chapter Label="matrices">
<Heading>Matrices</Heading>

A compressed matrix (a <C>cmat</C>) behaves very much like a list of
<C>cvec</C>s. However, it insists on having only <C>cvec</C>s of the
same length and over the same base field as its elements, and it insists
on being a list without holes. Apart from these restrictions, you can
use all the standard list operations with <C>cmat</C>s (see Section
<Ref Sect="matlists"/>. <P/>

In the rest of this chapter, we document all methods for matrices for the
sake of completeness. If they behave exactly as is to be expected by the
already defined operation no further explanation is given.

<Section Label="matcreation">
<Heading>Creation</Heading>

The basic operation to create new <C>cmat</C>s is <F>CMat</F>, for which
a variety of methods is available:

<ManSection>
<Meth Name="CMat" Arg="l, cl, dochecks"/>
<Meth Name="CMat" Arg="l, cl"/>
<Returns> a new <C>cmat</C> </Returns>
<Description>
    A new <C>cmat</C> is created with rows being in the <C>cvecclass</C>
    <A>cl</A>. All elements of the list <A>l</A> must be <C>cvec</C>s in
    that class. The boolean flag <A>dochecks</A> indicates, whether
    this should be checked or not. If the flag is omitted, checks are
    performed. Note that <A>l</A> may be the empty list.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Meth Name="CMat" Arg="l, dochecks"/>
<Meth Name="CMat" Arg="l"/>
<Returns> a new <C>cmat</C> </Returns>
<Description>
    A new <C>cmat</C> is created with rows being in the <C>cvecclass</C>
    of the vectors in <A>l</A>. All elements of the list <A>l</A> must 
    be <C>cvec</C>s in the same class. 
    The boolean flag <A>dochecks</A> indicates, whether
    this should be checked or not. If the flag is omitted, checks are
    performed. Note that <A>l</A> may not be the empty list.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Meth Name="CMat" Arg="l, v"/>
<Returns> a new <C>cmat</C> </Returns>
<Description>
    A new <C>cmat</C> is created with rows being in the <C>cvecclass</C>
    of the <C>cvec</C> <A>v</A>. All elements of the list <A>l</A> must 
    be <C>cvec</C>s in the that same class. This is checked.
    Note that <A>l</A> may be the empty list.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Meth Name="CMat" Arg="m"/>
<Returns> a new <C>cmat</C> </Returns>
<Description>
Creates a new <C>cmat</C> which is equal to <A>m</A>, which must be a
compressed matrix in the filter <F>IsGF2MatrixRep</F>
or the filter <F>Is8BitMatrixRep</F>.
</Description>
</ManSection>

There are some methods to create <C>cmat</C>s of special form:

<ManSection>
<Func Name="CVEC_ZeroMat" Arg="rows, cl"/>
<Func Name="CVEC_ZeroMat" Arg="rows, cols, p, d"/>
<Returns> a new <C>cmat</C> </Returns>
<Description>
    Creates a zero matrix with <A>rows</A> rows and <A>cols</A> columns
    over the field <C>GF(<A>p</A>,<A>d</A>)</C>. If a <C>cvecclass</C>
    <A>cl</A> is given, the number of columns and the field follow
    from that.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Func Name="CVEC_IdentityMat" Arg="rows, cl"/>
<Func Name="CVEC_IdentityMat" Arg="rows, cols, p, d"/>
<Returns> a new <C>cmat</C> </Returns>
<Description>
    Creates an identity matrix with <A>rows</A> rows and <A>cols</A> columns
    over the field <C>GF(<A>p</A>,<A>d</A>)</C>. If a <C>cvecclass</C>
    <A>cl</A> is given, the number of columns and the field follow
    from that.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Func Name="CVEC_RandomMat" Arg="rows, cl"/>
<Func Name="CVEC_RandomMat" Arg="rows, cols, p, d"/>

<Description>
    Creates a random matrix with <A>rows</A> rows and <A>cols</A> columns
    over the field <C>GF(<A>p</A>,<A>d</A>)</C>. If a <C>cvecclass</C>
    <A>cl</A> is given, the number of columns and the field follow
    from that. Note that this is not particularly efficient.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Meth Name="MutableCopyMat" Arg="m"/>

<Returns> a new mutable <C>cmat</C> </Returns>
<Description>
    Returns a new <C>cmat</C> containing the vectors in
    <A>vectorlist</A> as rows. The elements in <A>vectorlist</A> must be
    vectors of the same length as the sample vector <A>vector</A> and must
    live over the same base field. The sample
vector is always necessary to be able to use the method selection. The
<A>vectorlist</A> may be empty. The NC method does not check the inputs.

<Section Label="slicingmat">
<Heading>Slicing and submatrices</Heading>

As described in Section <Ref Sect="matlists"/> you can use the slicing
operator <C>&bslash;&obrace;&bslash;&cbrace;</C> for read and write
access of a subset of the rows of a <C>cmat</C>. However, the double
slicing operator is not supported. The reason for this is twofold: First
there is a technical issue that the double slicing operator cannot easily
be overloaded in the &GAP; system. The second is, that very often the
double slicing operator is used to copy a part of one matrix to another
part of another matrix using double slicing on both sides of an assignment.
This is quite inefficient because it creates an intermediate object, namely
the submatrix which is extracted.

<P/>
Therefore we have chosen to support submatrix access through two operations
<Ref Oper="ExtractSubMatrix"/> and <Ref Oper="CopySubMatrix"/> described
below.

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="ExtractSubMatrix" Arg="m, rows, cols"/>
<Returns> a submatrix of <A>m</A> </Returns>
<Description>
    This operation extracts the submatrix of the matrix <A>m</A> consisting
    of the rows described by the integer list (or range) <A>rows</A> and
    of the columns described by the integer list (or range) <A>cols</A>.
    This is thus equivalent to the usage 
    <A>m</A><C>&obrace;</C><A>rows</A><C>&cbrace;&obrace;</C><A>cols</A><C>&cbrace;</C>. 
    Note that the latter does not work for <C>cmat</C>s,
    whereas a quite efficient method for <Ref Oper="ExtractSubMatrix"/>
    is available for <C>cmat</C>s.
</Description>
</ManSection>

<ManSection>
<Oper Name="CopySubMatrix" Arg="src, dst, srows, drows, scols, dcols"/>
<Returns> nothing </Returns>
<Description>
    This operation extracts the submatrix of the matrix <A>src</A> consisting
    of the rows described by the integer list (or range) <A>srows</A> and
    of the columns described by the integer list (or range) <A>scols</A> and
    copies it into the submatrix of <A>dst</A> described by the integer lists
    (or ranges) <A>drows</A> and <A>dcols</A>. No intermediate object is
    created.
    This is thus equivalent to the usage 
    <A>dst</A><C>&obrace;</C><A>drows</A><C>&cbrace;&obrace;</C><A>dcols</A><C>&cbrace; := </C><A>src</A><C>&obrace;</C><A>srows</A><C>&cbrace;&obrace;</C><A>scols</A><C>&cbrace;</C>. 
    Note that the latter does not work for <C>cmat</C>s,

<Section Label="greasemat">
<Heading>Grease</Heading>

The basic idea behind the <Q>grease</Q> technique is that over a finite 
field there are only finitely many linear combinations of a fixed list
of vectors. Thus, many operations including matrix multiplication can be
speeded up by precomputing all possible linear combinations and then just
looking up the right one. For the case of matrix multiplication this can
for example gain a factor of about <M>4</M> over the field with
<M>2</M> elements using <Q>grease level<M>8</M></Q>, which means that
for blocks of <M>8</M> rows all linear combinations are precomputed.

<P/>
The <Package>cvec</Package> uses grease whenever appropriate automatically
for example for matrix multiplication. However, occasionally the user
has to take a conscious decision, which matrices to grease, because this 
of course uses more memory.

<P/>
A <C>cmat</C> can be <Q>pre-greased</Q> with level <M>l</M>, which means that 
it is chopped into chunks of <M>l</M> rows and for each such chunk all
possible linear combinations are precomputed and stored. This increases
the memory used to store the matrix by a factor of <M>q^l</M> if the 
base field of the matrix has <M>q</M> elements. However, operations like
vector matrix multiplication and matrix matrix multiplication (here the
right hand side matrix must be greased!) are speeded up. As a rule of
thumb the factor one can hope for is about <M>l \cdot (q-1)/q</M>.
Note that for big matrices matrix multiplication does greasing on the
fly anyway and therefore one cannot hope for such a big factor by
pre-greasing.

<Description>
    <A>m</A> must be a <C>cmat</C>. It is pregreased with level <A>l</A>.
    Without the argument <A>l</A> a grease level depending of the field
    size is chosen automatically. Note that the matrix will need much more
    memory when pregreased.

<Description>
<A>m</A> must be a <C>cmat</C> and <A>rs</A> must be a random source
object if given. This method changes the matrix <A>m</A> in place by
(pseudo) random values in the field over which the matrix lives. If
a random source is given, the pseudo random numbers used are taken from
this source, otherwise the global random source in the &GAP; library
is taken.
