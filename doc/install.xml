<Chapter Label="install">
<Heading>Installation of the <Package>cvec</Package>-Package</Heading>
<Index><Package>cvec</Package></Index>

To get the newest version of this &GAP; 4 package download one of the
archive files
<List>
<Item> <F>cvec-x.x.tar.gz</F> </Item>
<Item> <F>cvec-x.x.zoo</F> </Item>
<Item> <F>cvec-x.x.tar.bz2</F> </Item>
<Item> <F>cvec-x.x.zip</F> </Item>
</List>
and unpack it using 
<Verb>
    gunzip cvec-x.x.tar.gz; tar xvf cvec-x.x.tar
</Verb>
respectively
<Verb>
    unzoo -x cvec-x.x.zoo
</Verb>
and so on. <P/>

Do this in a directory called <Q><F>pkg</F></Q>, preferably (but not necessarily)
in the <Q><F>pkg</F></Q> subdirectory of your &GAP; 4 installation. It creates a
subdirectory called <Q><F>cvec</F></Q>.<P/>

The package  will not work without the following compilation step.<P/>

To compile the C part of the package do (in the <F>pkg</F> directory)

<Verb>
    cd cvec
    ./configure
    make
</Verb>

If you installed the package in another <Q><F>pkg</F></Q> directory than
the standard <Q><F>pkg</F></Q> directory in your &GAP; 4 installation,
then you have to do two things. Firstly during compilation 
you have to use the option
<C>--with-gaproot=PATH</C> of the <F>configure</F> script
where <Q>PATH</Q> is a path to the main &GAP; root directory 
(if not given the
default <Q><F>../..</F></Q> is assumed). <P/>
Secondly you have to 
specify the path to the directory containing your
<Q><F>pkg</F></Q>
directory to &GAP;'s list of directories. This can be done by starting
&GAP; with the <Q><F>-l</F></Q> command line option followed by the name
of the directory and a semicolon. Then your directory is prepended to
the list of directories searched. Otherwise the package is not found by
&GAP;. Of course, you can add this option to your &GAP; startup script.
<P/>

If you installed &GAP; on several architectures, you must execute the
configure/make step for each of the architectures. You can either
do this immediately after
configuring and compiling &GAP; itself on this architecture, or alternatively (when
using version 4.5 of &GAP; or newer) set the environment variable
<C>CONFIGNAME</C> to the name of the configuration you used when
compiling &GAP; before running <C>./configure</C>. 
Note however that your compiler choice and flags
(environment variables <C>CC</C> and <C>CFLAGS</C>) need to be
chosen to match the setup of the original &GAP; compilation. For
example you have to specify 32-bit or 64-bit mode correctly!<P/>
