    IsRowVectorObj by IsVectorObj, and of BaseField by BaseDomain)

2.7.3 (2019-07-11)
  - Rewrote build system to use gac, not autoconf/automake/libtool
  - Improve compatibility with upcoming GAP 4.11
  - Various janitorial changes

2.7.2 (2019-03-20)
  - Removed the (undocumented) Fold and Unfold method
  - Clarify the licensing terms again

2.7.1 (2019-02-23)
  - Fixed an incompatibility with GAP version >= 4.11

2.7.0 (2019-02-19)
  - Require GAP version >= 4.9
  - Clarify that license is GPL 2 *or later* (as agreed with Max N.)
  - Internal: stop using the GAP kernel variable PolsFF
  - Fix error viewing empty semiechelon matrices (patch provided by Frank
    Lübeck)
  - Fix bug in MinimalPolynomialOfMatrixMC which could lead to an infinite
    loop for certain inputs, in particular lower triangular matrices with
    multiple eigenvalues (patch provided by Frank Lübeck)
  - Add methods to allow access to cmats via  `mat[i,j]`
  - Various janitorial changes

2.6.1 (2018-06-07)
  - Workaround a linker issue with GNU ld 2.30
  - Improved build system when using GAP >= 4.9

2.6.0 (2018-03-20)
  - Fix crash in CLEANROWKERNEL
  - Fix link to issue tracker in manual
  - Adapt to changes in GAP's MatrixObj interface (to appear in GAP 4.9)
  - Convert README to markdown

2.5.7 (2017-08-01)
  - Remove CompatibleMatrix method (this *undocumented* API will be
    removed in GAP 4.9)
  - Fix several broken references in the manual

2.5.6 (2016-11-08)
  - Fix a bug reported by Jan De Beule which resulted in cvec incorrectly
    converting certain GAP matrices to cvec matrices.

2.5.5 (2016-03-08)
  - Maintenance release

2.5.4 (2015-12-18)
  - Some functions accept slightly more general input. For example, it
    is now in some cases acceptable to use finite field elements like
    Z(4)^0 (which is equal, but not identical, to Z(2)^0) as input when
    cvec is expecting elements of GF(2).
  - Fix EmptySemiEchelonBasis: its documentation said it expects a
    sample vector, but the implementation expected a sample matrix. Now
    both are possible, and both are documented.
  - Fix some errors in the manual.
  - Move website to https://gap-packages.github.io/cvec/
  - Stop using GenericHashFunc_C (formerly provided by the orb package)

2.5.3 (2014-11-08)
  - Tweak the build system to avoid potential issues when the source
    code gets repackages by third parties (e.g. by the GAP team, when
    creating their big package archives)

2.5.2 (2014-09-24)
  - Fix some minor issues in the documentation
  - Remove some leftover GAP 4.4 compatibility code
  - Update Max Neunhoeffer's contact data
  - Use AutoDoc to generate title page of the manual from PackageInfo.g
  - Add Max Horn as a maintainer

2.5.1 (2014-04-04)
  - Previous release had an invalid release date in
    PackageInfo.g (2014-04-31 instead of 2014-03-31).
  - Merge HISTORY and CHANGES files.

2.5 (2014-03-31)
