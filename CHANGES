This file describes changes in the cvec package.

2.X.X
  - Fix link to issue tracker in manual

2.5.7 (2017-08-01)
  - Remove CompatibleMatrix method (this *undocumented* API will be
    removed in GAP 4.9)
  - Fix several broken references in the manual

2.5.6 (2016-11-08)
  - Fix a bug reported by Jan De Beule which resulted in cvec incorrectly
    converting certain GAP matrices to cvec matrices.

2.5.5 (2016-03-08)
  - Maintenance release

2.5.4 (2015-12-18)
  - Some functions accept slightly more general input. For example, it
    is now in some cases acceptable to use finite field elements like
    Z(4)^0 (which is equal, but not identical, to Z(2)^0) as input when
    cvec is expecting elements of GF(2).
  - Fix EmptySemiEchelonBasis: its documentation said it expects a
    sample vector, but the implementation expected a sample matrix. Now
    both are possible, and both are documented.
  - Fix some errors in the manual.
  - Move website to http://gap-packages.github.io/cvec/
  - Stop using GenericHashFunc_C (formerly provided by the orb package)

2.5.3 (2014-11-08)
  - Tweak the build system to avoid potential issues when the source
    code gets repackages by third parties (e.g. by the GAP team, when
    creating their big package archives)

2.5.2 (2014-09-24)
  - Fix some minor issues in the documentation
  - Remove some leftover GAP 4.4 compatibility code
  - Update Max Neunhoeffer's contact data
  - Use AutoDoc to generate title page of the manual from PackageInfo.g
  - Add Max Horn as a maintainer

2.5.1 (2014-04-04)
  - Previous release had an invalid release date in
    PackageInfo.g (2014-04-31 instead of 2014-03-31).
  - Merge HISTORY and CHANGES files.

2.5 (2014-03-31)
  - Add methods for \^ for cvecs and Frobenius automorphisms
  - Add methods for \^ for cmats and Frobenius automorphisms
  - Fix a bug in unpickling semi echelonised bases
  - Update and tweak the package build system
  - Move package repository and website to GitHub

    as a method for MinimalPolynomial for row list matrices.

  - Put revision 402 as version 1.8 on the web

1.7 (2007-09-26)
  - Introduce filters for cmats and cvecs to distinguish cases of q=p
    and q <= MAXSIZE_GF_INTERNAL.
  - Kernel method for cmat row access
  - Operation ScalarProductsRows with kernel method for prime fields
    used for condensation
  - Fixed infinite recursion in matrix multiplication because of
    Winograd method.
  - Fixed problem of polynomial factorisation over "DefaultField"
    instead of BaseDomain in Minimal and Characteristic polynomial
    routines.
  - New method for SumIntersectionMat for cmats. 
  - Use constructors for new objects in new interface, implement them.
  - Change all addresses to St Andrews.
  - Require GAP >= 4.4.9
  - Tune vector matrices interface and polish implementation.
  - Added a pickling/unpickling method for semi echelon basis.
  - Quite a few little changes to the vector/matrix interface
    after discussions in Braunschweig.

  - Put AddMatrix and MultMatrix into interface and implement it for cmats
  - Put revision 298 as version 1.6 on the web.

1.5 (2007-02-07)
  - Improve usage of grease, in particular for level 1 for 2 < q < 257
  - Improve FILL_GREASE_TAB by using trick coming from analysis: we only
    have to multiply a few times by the primitive root, not by powers of it.
  - Fixed a serious bug in SemiEchelonBasisMutableTX which occurred if
    the first row of the matrix was zero.
  - New operation CompanionMatrix (not yet documented)
